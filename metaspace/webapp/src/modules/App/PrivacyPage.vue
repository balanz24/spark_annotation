    <p>
      It is our policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our website.
      This Privacy Policy applies to

      information may be collected on our Website, how we use this information, and under what circumstances we may
      disclose the information to third parties. This Privacy Policy applies only to information we collect through
      the Website and does not apply to our collection of information from other sources.

      </router-link>

    <h2>User-submitted data</h2>
    <p>
      When uploading scientific data to METASPACE you have several options to control the visibility of your data to
      other users. Even if you indicate that the data should be kept private, it is still visible to METASPACE
      administrators. Furthermore, other visibility options such as associating the data to a Group or Project may allow
      other users to see this data. Please take the time to review the Visibility and Data Management options before
      submitting a private dataset to prevent accidentally allowing access to it by other parties.
    </p>
    <h2>Website visitors</h2>
    <p>
      Like most website operators, METASPACE collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web
      browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and
      the date and time of each visitor request. Our purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to
      better understand how METASPACE's visitors use the website. From time to time, we may release
      non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of
      the website.
    </p>
    <p>
      METASPACE also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for
      users accessing
      <a
        href="https://metaspace2020.eu"
        rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"
      >
        https://metaspace2020.eu<!-- -->
      </a>. METASPACE only discloses logged in user IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses
      personally-identifying information as described below.
    </p>
    <h2>Personally-identifying information</h2>
    <p>
      When creating an account or submitting data to METASPACE you will be asked to provide your name and email address.
      This personally-identifying information will be stored and used to publicly attribute your submitted data to you.
      Your email address will be hidden from the general public, but may be shown to other users if you join a Group or
      Project.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your information may be shared with these third-party data processors:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <b>Google Analytics</b> &mdash; used for tracking feature usage and anonymized information about users such as
          browser, country and referrer. This data is collected exclusively to help decision making for improving
          METASPACE.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <b>Sentry.io</b> &mdash; used for detecting browser errors that occur while using the website. This data is
          collected to help us find and fix bugs.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      With these services we have made our best effort to configure them to avoid collecting personally identifiable
      information, however it is possible that they will receive information such as database IDs, search terms or IP
      addresses that could indirectly identify you.
    </p>
    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>
      The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the
      Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to
      protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
